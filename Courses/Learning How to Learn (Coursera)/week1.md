# Week 1: What is Learning?
#### Introduction to Focused and Diffuse Modes
- When learning something new, your mind needs to constantly swap between two different learning modes
- To build neural structure - gradually allow yourself to grow a neuro-scaffold to hang your thinking on a little bit every day
- Focused Mode: concentrating on familiar things
- Diffuse Mode: relaxed mode of thinking where "thoughts are free to wander"

#### What is Learning?
- Certain brain areas are more active when resting which can be further divided into groups of areas that have common patterns of activity
- Brain connectivity is dynamic and remains so even after it matures

#### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep
- When you look at something you rather not do, brain areas associated with pain are activated and brain looks for ways to stop negative stimulation by switching attention to something else 
- However, it was discovered that not long after people started actually working, the neurodiscomfort disappeared 
- Pomodoro technique is a mental tool used to overcome this - it is simply a 25 minute timer and after, a small reward is given when you're done
- Pomodoro results in brief periods of focused attention
- Neurons are linked together through repeated use - the more abstract, the more practice is required for the formation of these neural thought patterns
- Working memory
    - Works on the immediate and conscious processing 
    - Holds about 4 chunks of information which are groups of memory items
    - Often need to repeat what you're trying to work with so it stays in working memory
    - Similar to an inefficient mental blackboard
- Long term memory
    - Different kinds of long-term memories are stored in different regions of the brain
    - Fundamental concepts and techniques involved in what you're learning is stored here
    - Similar to a storage warehouse
- Encountering new information is working memory and to move that information into long-term memory, it takes time and practice
- Utilize spaced repetition - repeating what you are trying to learn over multiple sessions
- Sleep clears metabolic toxins from brain after a day of "brain use" - best to sleep directly after learning new things
