# Object Oriented Programming

### Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications.
- Allows the programming to block off areas of code that perform certain tasks independently of other areas in the application
- *Encapsulation* is the concept of blocking off areas of code and not making it available to the rest of the program
- *Abstraction* is simplifying a complex process of a program, an enterprise software solution for example by modeling classes appropriate for it
- *Inheritance* is used where a class inherits the behaviour of another class, referred to as the superclass
- *Polymorphism* is when a class inherits the behaviours of another class, but has the ability to not inherit everything and change some of its inherited behaviours, for example, to write a method that does something differently from the inherited method
- *Classes* are blueprints that describe the state and behaviour that the objects of the class all share
- A class can be used to create many objects
- Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class
